# 🛡️ My TryHackMe Journey

## 🚀 Welcome!

Welcome to my TryHackMe repo — a simple, personal log of rooms I try, techniques I learn, and little wins along the way. This repo is for notes, screenshots, commands, and short write-ups so I can look back, remember what I tried, and show progress over time.
